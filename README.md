# Dreamers_FinalProject
The final project represents the development of a 2D side scrolling platformer game created using the Godot game engine. The main features of the game are a playable character that can run, jump, collect collectibles, and attack. The player navigates through dangerous obstacles. The objective is to survive and collect 5 diamonds on each level, then advance to the next level 3 times. The main purpose of this project was to demonstrate core game development skills. Also providing us with an excellent portfolio piece for our job hunt endeavors. We handled animations, enemy behavior, collision detection, UI design, and sound integration. The game brings a single player gameplay, survival challenges, sprite animations, enemy logic, and full menu systems. The game was developed using Godot 4.3 and GDScript. We used custom assets from itch.io. The game architecture design follows a structured modular design. This report will go further in depth in the purpose, architecture design, requirement specifications, design, and our test plans used, while also providing a user manual for our game.
